        <p>Workshops are the fuel that powers our journey as Vihiga's women in business. They are dynamic spaces where knowledge is shared, skills are honed, and connections are forged. These transformative experiences not only equip us with the tools we need to thrive but also foster a sense of unity and camaraderie, reminding us that together, there is no limit to what we can achieve</p>
